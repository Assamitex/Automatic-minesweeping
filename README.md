# Automatic-minesweeping
Automatic minesweeping for Windows XP classic version minesweeper by Python3.7

Operating environment:
Windows 10
Python 3.7
Windows XP Minesweeper

Operation mode:
1. Turn on mine clearance to ensure that the minesweeper interface is not blocked by other windows.
2. Run main.py in Python or run "automatic minesweeper.exe" directly

note:
1. If the mine clearance fails, the program will automatically restart until the mine clearance is successful. If you want to quit during the period, you can only force it to quit.
2. The reason for the high rate of mine clearance failure is that one situation has not been considered. This situation is the result of using the connection between multiple blocks. Since I am lazy, I have not improved.
